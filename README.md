# Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll

This will run a shell script that will "Rick Roll" the first user that runs the Repl and then it will erase all evidence.

## Instructions 
1. Download it using the Repl.it terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DiegoPerez1441/Repl.it_DissapearingRickRoll.git
```
2. Either use the File Manager GUI or the terminal, move `.replit` and `startup.sh` to the same folder that `Main.java` is located
3. Run the Repl using the start button

## Disclaimer
This program only runs once hence the "erase all evidence" part. 
I'm not responsible for any damages caused by this program and it is meant for educational purposed only.

## To-Do
1. Add a second script to automate step 2 from Instructions
2. Maybe Compress Code into a one-liner for ease of use and replace it inside of the `.replit` file for a one file solution
3. Instead of a static image of rickroll, use the actual video or redirect to video on YouTube
